# Kiwi Menu

Kiwi Menu replaces the Activities button with a compact, macOS-inspired launcher that keeps your most common session actions one click away.

## Features

- **macOS-style panel button**: Swaps the Activities label for a tidy icon-only trigger that blends into GNOME Shell.
- **Curated session controls**: Sleep, restart, shut down, lock, and log out entries mirror the macOS Apple menu workflow.
- **Recent items submenu**: Hover or click to browse recent files and folders with automatic section headers and quick launch support.
- **Force Quit overlay**: Launches the built-in xkill helper from the menu when an app misbehaves.
- **Adaptive logout label**: Personalizes the log out entry with your full name when available.
- **Preferences that persist**: Remembers window geometry so the settings dialog reopens exactly how you left it.


## Testing changes

1. Apply your edits.
2. Recompile the schema if keys changed.
3. Reload the extension:
   ```bash
   gnome-extensions disable kiwimenu@kemma
   gnome-extensions enable kiwimenu@kemma
   ```
4. Tail GNOME Shell logs when debugging:
   ```bash
   journalctl --user-unit gnome-shell -f
   ```

## Known issues

- Recent files require GNOME to populate `recently-used.xbel`; newly installed systems may need activity before entries appear.
